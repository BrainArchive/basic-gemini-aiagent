# An AI Agent using the Google Gemini's API 
## Guided Project.
requirements to run:
- A Gemini API key 
- Python3
- the Gemini Python libraries


Installing the require libraries:
```pip install requirements.txt```

You'll also need a Gemini API key which you can get from [here](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

create a `.env` and put in:
``` GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR API KEY HERE" ```

## WARNING

Although functional, barely has any guard-rails. This Guide project was done specifically to learn how to use the Gemini API and to get it to iterate on itself.
